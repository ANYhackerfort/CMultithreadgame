Project by: Matthew Zhang & Tony Li

============
The objective is to create an Elden Ring open world game. This game has 10 maps (or areas) like Elden ring and when a user beats an area, the user can tp to any area even while they are completing a level but once they leave, the square of the level they are on gets reset (like an elden ring boss) but the other bosses (squares) that are beat gets saved so users can skip through the beat areas of the map. Progress is stored in 10 map objects. 
============

Teleportation:
Users can always /displaymap to get all the maps they can travel to and once they enter the code, they can travel there (like an elden ring map).

Other commands:
When you are traveling with an animation, you are hinted at commands to check your health and items in your inventory. 

Rules:
- Once you lose all your health, all progress is lost at that square, you have to start over.
- Items are rare but once you find them, you can use it to skip past attacks. 
- When you decide to move away to another square, all progress is lost. That's the challening part! 
- Once you beat the square, the number of square beat gets incremented, you can not try to beat the square again!

How to win:
- You only need to complete 10 squares of the ten maps, you can choose any. But once you lose all your health! GAME OVER EVERYTHING RESETS!

The whole code is written by us while referring to slides / past coding assignments. We also referred to resources such as stack overflow for debugging for std::shared_ptrs and race conditions of having 2 threads (we just have 1 now, apprently its race conditioning the reading of the input conosle and the output console).
